# Geo578Project
Final group project for Geo 578.

Using raster files to create a predictive model for archaeological site suitability


Project description:

  Use ArcPy to import Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Stream/hydrology, and ecological raster data.
  Classify the information in the raster cells into user-defined bins or categories.
  Multiply the reclassified raster files.
  The new output file will contain numerical values that display site suitability (high numbers = high suitability, low values = low       suitability, zero values = not suitable at all).
  The output data can then be displayed with a "hot to cold" color ramp, in order to visually display the predicted data.
